# Traffic  Management

We can all surely agree on the fact that, traffic congestion in the major cities has gotten significantly worse. The widespread use of automobiles has raised the need for better transportation infrastructure, which has been linked to congestion.Smart city efforts must include intelligent traffic infrastructure. It consists of integrated intelligent transportation systems with things like adaptive traffic signal controls, highway management and emergency management services. These technologies can gather real-time traffic data and take the appropriate action to prevent or lessen any problem brought on by traffic congestion. The increased traffic has increased traveling problems like long waiting times, fuel wastages, long vehicle queue and accidents mainly in the intersection area. Fixed-cycle light controllers are not efficient these days. They are not solving the long vehicle queue and waiting time problem.Traffic management is used to assess the traffic conditions and density for a better transportation system. The analysis of traffic includes object detection and tracking, counting of vehicle, congestion of traffic, measurement of the vehicle. The object detection will be carried out using YOLO, the tracking is done using deepsort.The project has three parts. The dashboard, the backend, and the working model. The dashboard displays the results and statistics, the backend which is the computational unit, and the IoT model presents the working aspects of the project.The need for management of traffic is apparent. It helps to reduce the fuel consumption in vehicles by 20-25\%, reducing unwanted pollution. Saves time and reduces crowds and further increases ease of travel.
